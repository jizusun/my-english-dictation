hello and welcome to sketch together
my name is Paula Stanley
and this is a crash course on principle for mac
principle is a great tool 
for creating user interface animations and prototypes
on this session 
we're going to learn how to use continuous interactions
like dragging scrolling and paging
which creates a really cool prototypes
and really cool gestures on your on your ideas
so let's go ahead and do that 
there are three common interactions 
that are built into principle 
these ones are dragging scrolling and page scrolling
and these can be found here 
when you select on the inspector 
you select a layer or a group 
you can enable them here horizontally or vertically 
and let's start with scrolling 
and scrolling can be enabled here on a group layer
like this one which is a long layer 
and this when a finger is dragged on a scrolling layer 
the child layers will move with the finger
but the group itself will not change position 
so Maps message stress or any large content 
make great candidates for scrolling 
so let's go ahead and try it out on this example 
so for example here I'm going to zoom out a little bit
so you can see I have a long set of cards 
that are here on the bottom 
so I want to make this a scrollable vertically 
and I also have this these thumb images 
that I want to make scrollable horizontally 
so as you can see here in the preview 
I cannot do anything because I haven't done anything scrollable 
so I'm going to go ahead and select this group of cards 
and I'm going to go to vertical 
and I'm going to make it a scrollable 
and now it can start scrolling here 
but see how it doesn't go all the way to the bottom
just like bounces right there and that's because 
I the size of this it's a this size and the cropping is there 
and I have to make it the size of the actual artboard of my actual content 
but actually I'm going to make it the size of this 
that way it this is the edge of the scrolling 
and now if I test it out 
now I can go all the way to the bottom 
and if I wanted to go see how it's scrubbing right here 
if I wanted to go all the way to the hello the header 
I can go ahead and just change this to the size of this 
and now it goes below the header 
that's cool 
and now that's a vertical scrolling 
and I want to make a horizontal scrolling on the set of images 
so I'm going to select this group 
and I'm going to do the same 
but it's now in the horizontal axis 
so I'm going to make it a scrollable 
and if I test it out see how to make this a little bit bigger 
so we can see it 
now I can scroll this 
but just the same as the vertical scrolling 
it snaps in it doesn't go all the way to the left 
and to solve this I just need to make this a little bit smaller 
I'm going to make this actually the size of this 
and now I can scroll all the way to the left 
and it bounces and looks pretty cool 
so yeah that's the basic of scrolling 
now I'm going to teach you about how to use patient interaction 
and pigeon is just like scrolling 
except it automatically snaps it's a straw position 
to group size increments when the scrolling ends 
and I'm going to show you an example of how to do this 
here I have a sketch file 
where I have a walkthrough up screen as you can see here 
let me drag this outside the airport so you can see 
I have three images and I want to be able to scroll through them 
and snap to the size of the screen when I scroll through them 
so I'm going to go to command Z 
and I'm going to go to principle 
and I'm going to create a new file 
I'm going to import my files 
and I have it here if i zoom out 
I can see this image images that are there 
and now we want to add a horizontal paging scrolling over here on the inspector 
so just select that 
and now if I go over here I can start dragging it 
but it doesn't snap it doesn't go all the way 
and that's because having the size of the group is all the way here 
and I actually wanted to beat this size the size of the artwork 
and if now if I drag it snaps to the size of the artboard magically 
which is really cool 
and obviously the other elements stay fixed 
since those are not draggable or scrollable 
so yeah you can use paging for image carousels or for home screens 
or for cards animations and stuff like this 
and it creates a really cool effect 
so yeah 
now let's learn how to add dragon interactions 
and you want to enable dragon on layer when you like to allow the layers position to move 
when a touch is held over it 
so for example I want to be able to drag this image 
so I'm going to go ahead and here in horizontal 
I'm going to go to drag and vertical I'm going to go to drag too 
and now here in the preview 
as you can see now I can start dragging this element on the X or Y position vertically and horizontally 
and this one since I haven't done anything to it I cannot drag it 
so I can change that but just selecting it 
and then for example let's do it only horizontally a drag horizontally 
and now it's bound to just the x position 
I can only drag it horizontally 
but if I were to make it drag also vertically I can just drag it anywhere on the campus 
which is pretty cool 
and that's pretty cool but sometimes you want to do something that is a little bit more useful 
like for example a map 
so over here on my sketch file I have a map already 
and I'm going to import it here the principal 
going to close this guy 
and I'm going to create a new file 
and I'm going to import it 
and then here zoom out a little bit 
and here I have this element and I want to be able to drag the map on the campus 
and to do that just as the previous example 
I can do it by selecting the group 
and I'm going to make it draggable horizontally and also vertically 
and since I didn't do anything to the header 
the header header will remain static so I'm going to preview it here 
let me make this a little bit bigger so we can see it 
and as you can see I dragged the map around 
and I can I can preview a map and only add different elements and on the X or Y position 
and is reacting to my touch 
which is pretty cool for this kind of purpose
