hello and welcome to sketch together
大家好 欢迎来到 Sketch Together


my name is Paula Stanley
我是 Paula Stanley


and this is a crash course on principle for mac
这是一个 Mac 上 Principle 的速成教程 


principle is a great tool 
Principle 是一个优秀的工具


for creating user interface animations and prototypes
能创建用户界面、动画和原型


on this session
在本节课中


we're going to learn how to use continuous interactions
我们会学习如何使用 continous interactions（连续交互）


like dragging scrolling and paging
例如拖拽、滚动和分页


which creates a really cool prototypes
它能使你的原型更酷炫


and really cool gestures on your on your ideas
手势更酷炫


so let's go ahead and do that 
让我们开始吧


there are three common interactions that are built into principle 
有三种常见的、Principle 内置的交互



these ones are dragging scrolling and page scrolling
它们是 拖拽、滚动和分页滚动


and these can be found here when you select on the inspector 
你可以在 Inspector（查看器）中找到它们


you select a layer or a group 
首先要选中一个图层或一个组


you can enable them here horizontally or vertically 
然后分别在 Horizontal （水平）或 Vertical（垂直）方向上启用它们


and let's start with scrolling 
我们先来学习 Scrolling（滚动）


and scrolling can be enabled here on a group layer
可以在一组图层上启用滚动


like this one which is a long layer 
例如这就是一个很长的图层


and this when a finger is dragged on a scrolling layer 
当你在滚动图层上拖拽时


the child layers will move with the finger
子图层也会随之移动


but the group itself will not change position 
但是组本身并不会移动位置


so maps message stress or any large content 
所以 地图、消息条、或任何较大的内容


make great candidates for scrolling 
都适合做成滚动的


so let's go ahead and try it out on this example 
我们首先用这个例子来试一下


so for example here 
例如这里


I'm going to zoom out a little bit
我先稍微放大一下


so you can see I have a long set of cards 
如你所见 这是很长的一组卡片


that are here on the bottom 
一直到最底部


so I want to make this a scrollable vertically 
我希望它们能垂直滚动


and I also have this these thumb images 
这里还有缩略图


that I want to make scrollable horizontally 
我希望它们能水平滚动


so as you can see here in the preview 
在 Preview（预览）框中可以看到


I cannot do anything because I haven't done anything scrollable 
我什么也做不了 因为我还没将任何内容设置为滚动


so I'm going to go ahead and select this group of cards 
我现在首先选中这一组卡片


and I'm going to go to vertical and I'm going to make it a scrollable 
在“ Vertical（垂直）”这儿 我选择 Scroll（滚动）


and now it can start scrolling here 
现在它可以滚动了


but see how it doesn't go all the way to the bottom
但它并不能一直滚动到最底部


just like bounces right there 
像这样 在这里就会反弹


and that's because 
这是因为尺寸的问题


I the size of this it's a this size and the cropping is there 
在这个位置就被裁剪了


and I have to make it the size of the actual artboard of my actual content 


but actually I'm going to make it the size of this  


that way it this is the edge of the scrolling  


and now if I test it out  


now I can go all the way to the bottom  


and if I wanted to go see how it's scrubbing right here  


if I wanted to go all the way to the hello the header  


I can go ahead and just change this to the size of this  


and now it goes below the header  


that's cool  


and now that's a vertical scrolling  


and I want to make a horizontal scrolling on the set of images  


so I'm going to select this group  


and I'm going to do the same  


but it's now in the horizontal axis  


so I'm going to make it a scrollable  


and if I test it out see how to make this a little bit bigger  


so we can see it  


now I can scroll this  


but just the same as the vertical scrolling  


it snaps in it doesn't go all the way to the left  


and to solve this I just need to make this a little bit smaller  


I'm going to make this actually the size of this  


and now I can scroll all the way to the left  


and it bounces and looks pretty cool  


so yeah that's the basic of scrolling  


now I'm going to teach you about how to use patient interaction  


and pigeon is just like scrolling  


except it automatically snaps it's a straw position  


to group size increments when the scrolling ends  


and I'm going to show you an example of how to do this  


here I have a sketch file  


where I have a walkthrough up screen as you can see here  


let me drag this outside the airport so you can see  


I have three images and I want to be able to scroll through them  


and snap to the size of the screen when I scroll through them  


so I'm going to go to command Z  


and I'm going to go to principle  


and I'm going to create a new file  


I'm going to import my files  


and I have it here if i zoom out  


I can see this image images that are there  


and now we want to add a horizontal paging scrolling over here on the inspector  


so just select that  


and now if I go over here I can start dragging it  


but it doesn't snap it doesn't go all the way  


and that's because having the size of the group is all the way here  


and I actually wanted to beat this size the size of the artwork  


and if now if I drag it snaps to the size of the artboard magically  


which is really cool  


and obviously the other elements stay fixed  


since those are not draggable or scrollable  


so yeah you can use paging for image carousels or for home screens  


or for cards animations and stuff like this  


and it creates a really cool effect  


so yeah  


now let's learn how to add dragon interactions  


and you want to enable dragon on layer when you like to allow the layers position to move  


when a touch is held over it  


so for example I want to be able to drag this image  


so I'm going to go ahead and here in horizontal  


I'm going to go to drag and vertical I'm going to go to drag too  


and now here in the preview  


as you can see now I can start dragging this element on the X or Y position vertically and horizontally  


and this one since I haven't done anything to it I cannot drag it  


so I can change that but just selecting it  


and then for example let's do it only horizontally a drag horizontally  


and now it's bound to just the x position  


I can only drag it horizontally  


but if I were to make it drag also vertically I can just drag it anywhere on the campus  


which is pretty cool  


and that's pretty cool but sometimes you want to do something that is a little bit more useful  


like for example a map  


so over here on my sketch file I have a map already  


and I'm going to import it here the principal  


going to close this guy  


and I'm going to create a new file  


and I'm going to import it  


and then here zoom out a little bit  


and here I have this element and I want to be able to drag the map on the campus  


and to do that just as the previous example  


I can do it by selecting the group  


and I'm going to make it draggable horizontally and also vertically  


and since I didn't do anything to the header  


the header header will remain static so I'm going to preview it here  


let me make this a little bit bigger so we can see it  


and as you can see I dragged the map around  


and I can I can preview a map and only add different elements and on the X or Y position  


and is reacting to my touch  


which is pretty cool for this kind of purpose
