Flinto - Adding Scrolling Areas
5-6. 使用 Flinto 创建可卷动的区域 

Flinto allows you to add scrolling areas to your screen really easily
Flinto 可以让您轻松地在屏幕上添加可滚动的区域
 
you just have to select some layers or some groups
你只需要选择某些图层或组
 
and then make them a scrollable
然后将它们设置成“可滚动” (scrollable)
 
and then you can also control the scroll direction,the scrollbar color,
你也可以控制滚动的方向、滚动条的颜色
 
and also, if the scrolling is paged,
以及，滚动是否启用分页
 
and other cool stuff if it's bouncing, stuff like that
还有其他一些很酷的东西，比如可以带有反弹效果
 
so for example here, I want to make this the home screen of this prototype
例如，我想让它成为这个原型的主屏幕
 
I want these three images to be scroll horizontally
我希望这三张图片能水平滚动
 
as you can see here, there are three images
正如你所看到的，有三张图片
 
I want to be able to scroll horizontally
我想让它们能水平滚动
 
but not only that
但不仅如此
 
but I also want them to be a snap to the size of the page
我还希望它们能够适应页面的大小
 
so I can just select this group
所以我可以选择这个组
 
and then here in the group options
然后在这里 —— “组选项” (Group Options)
 
I have the ability to make it a scrollable here
我可以将其设置为可滚动的
 
so I'm going to make it a scroll horizontally
所以，这里我将它设置为水平可滚动的(Scroll - Horizontal)
 
and then I'm going to enable paging
然后我会启用分页(paging)
 
and let's preview it
现在预览一下
 
see, works like magic
看，很神奇！
 
as you can see only that group with the images is what scrolling
你可以看到，只有那个包含图像的组才能滚动
 
the rest of the elements are by default, just static 
其余的元素保持默认设置，也就是静止的
 
so that's cool
所以很酷
 
Now I'm going to create a quick link to this screen
现在，我要创建一个到这个屏幕的快速链接
 
I'm going to do fade in
我希望能淡入
 
and then here, I want to make this group vertically scrollable
然后在这儿, 我想让这个组垂直滚动
 
but I also want to have a different group inside this group
但我还想在这个组里面设置一个不同的组
 
a nested group that Scrolls horizontally
一个能水平滚动的嵌套组
 
so let's start by making this scrollable vertically
所以首先我们来设置让它能垂直滚动
 
so this group I'm going to go here in the options scroll
所以，对这个组，我找到 选项 -> 滚动 
 
I'm going to make it vertical scrolling
然后让它垂直滚动
 
and I'm going to preview it
然后预览一下
 
here, let's go
点这里，“让我们开始”
 
and I can scroll vertically
我可以垂直滚动
 
that's pretty cool
这很酷
 
that's exactly what I wanted
这正是我想要的
 
but now I want to make this scrollable horizontally
但现在，我想让它能水平滚动
 
and I can do this by selecting double clicking here
我可以选择并双击这里 
 
and now I'm going to this a nested group, I'm going to make it horizontally scroll
现在，我想让这个嵌套组使其水平滚动
 
so I'm going to first of all this layer, I'm going to make it a group
所以，首先我要将这一层合并为一组
 
because single layers you cannot make a scrollable unless they are a group
因为单个图层无法滚动，除非它们是一个组
 
so I press command G
所以我按 ⌘(Command) + G
 
now that is a new group
现在它就变成了一个新的组
 
I want to change the name to "horizontal-scroll"
我将其命名为"horizontal-scroll" (水平滚动)
 
you don't have to do this, I like to do that
你不一定要这样做，只是我喜欢而已

and then, here on the group options to select horizontal scroll, and that's it. 
接着，在组选项中，选择水平滚动，就这样。
 
I'm going to keep it bouncy, and let's preview it
这里我设置为 bouncy (反弹)，并预览它
 
and as you can see now it's a scrollable
正如你现在看到的，现在它是可滚动的了
 
but it also cuts here it crops here
但它在这里被切断了，被裁剪了
 
and it doesn't go all the way to the left
它不会一路走到左边
 
and that's because we haven't edited the crop of it
那是因为我们还没设置它的裁剪位置
 
so here I just going to zoom in
所以这里我把它放大
 
and I'm going to say it is going to crop here
我希望它将在这里被裁剪

the edge of the artboard, and also here
也就是画板的边缘，就是这里
 
this is going to be the size of the scrollable area
这才是滚动区域的大小
 
so I'm going to make it here
所以我拖动到这里
 
and that way it will bring the whole element to the left
这样，它就会把整个元素带到左边
 
let's preview it
让我们预览一下
 
and now I'm able to scroll all the way to the left
现在我可以一直滚动到最左边
 
and all the way to the right
以及一直滚动到最右边
 
and that's it you can make any group or any element on your designs scrollable with flinto
就是这样。你可以在 Flinto 中让任何组或任何元素实现滚动
 
Oh which is pretty pretty cool
这相当相当酷
 
you can make it paging like this
你可以使它像这样有分页效果 
 
you can make it vertically scrolling like this
你可以让它像这样垂直滚动
 
and also you can add nested groups that are independently scrollable
也可以添加嵌套组，并让它独立地滚动
 
pretty cool stuff
很酷的东西！
